# Project Notes - FlowState

## Origin Story

This project was conceived while exploring **Vibecoding** - the flow-first, mood-driven approach to coding that blends music, GenAI tools, and visual-first learning.

## Product Concept: Mood-Adaptive Productivity Dashboard

A tool for **Silver Wolf Labs** that helps developers and creators stay in flow while coding.

### Core Features to Build

1. **Mood Detection** - Track productivity patterns and suggest optimal environments
2. **Music Integration** - Lofi, ambient, and focus music recommendations (like Lofi Cafe, Brain.fm, Noisli, Endel)
3. **Focus Sessions** - Pomodoro-style timers with adaptive breaks
4. **AI Integration** - Connect with coding assistants for seamless workflow
5. **Analytics Dashboard** - Visualize productivity trends over time

### Target Audience

- Developers looking for flow state
- Remote workers
- Creators and designers
- Students learning to code

### Inspiration (from Vibecoding principles)

- **Mood-Based Coding** - Set the vibe with music to improve focus and flow
- **Visual Feedback Loops** - Instant output to learn by seeing
- **Chunk-Based Learning** - Focus on one concept at a time
- **AI-Augmented Building** - Use co-pilots to guide, debug, and explain

### Tech Stack Ideas

- **Frontend**: React/Next.js or Electron (for desktop app)
- **Backend**: Node.js or Python
- **AI**: OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- **Music**: Spotify API, YouTube API, or custom integrations
